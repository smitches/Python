# Python

CS 303 is an introductory course where I learned list manipulation and iteration
to achieve different results that required problem solving thinking.

CS 313 is the most OOP course of the three. Most of the course was used to learn
about Data Types (Stack, Deque, Queue, Linked List) to approach problems in a more
organized manner.

MIS 304 is the business course where Python is taught. It included GUI(TKinter)
for a checkout and OOP towards the last few homeworks.

Independent Projects are projects I have completed without a course.
